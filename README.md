## Hi, I'm Sydney 👋

I'm an undergraduate mathematics major with interests in applied mathematics, machine learning, and computational neuroscience. My work focuses on how representations shape learning, behavior, and decision-making.

I've worked on:
- Interpretable explanations of kernel methods
- Representation choices in function approximation
- Computational analysis of animal behavior using pose estimation
- Applied modeling under uncertainty

Some of my code is kept private due to research sensitivity, but I'm happy to share selected work upon request.
